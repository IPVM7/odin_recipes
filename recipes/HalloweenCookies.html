        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
            I used chocolate to make a screaming ghost face design on these Halloween-themed ice cream cookie sandwiches,
             just so I could do a play on words.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 large chocolate chip cookies</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons melted dark chocolate</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons melted white chocolate</li>
            <li>Â½ cup vanilla ice cream</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cover the flat side of 4 cookies with melted dark chocolate; 
                tap the cookies lightly to smooth out the chocolate.</li>
            <li>While still wet, use a piping bag or spoon to make a ghost 
                shape with the white chocolate; tap lightly once more to smooth as needed. 
                More white designs can be added to the dark chocolate background if desired.</li>
            <li>Use melted dark chocolate to make the eyes and screaming mouth; 
                tap or shake once more to even and smooth out.</li>
            <li>Let chocolate cool until hard and dry to the touch, at least 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Scoop ice cream on 4 remaining cookies, and cover with the tops. 
                Carefully press to flatten, and transfer to a freezer to freeze thoroughly before serving.</li>
        </ol>
